# An analysis and visualisation of responses given by kaggle users. 

Context: The goal of the Kaggle DS & ML survey is to better understand current trends in data
science and machine learning. This document describes the questions and answer choices that
were presented to survey respondents.

The kaggle survey showed a lot about the users of kaggle. Based on their responses we can learn more about life of Machine Learning and Data Anlysis enthusiasts -their education, professional experience etc., but also about the market - what technologies and programming languages are popular, what are the best and most popular sources of knowledge or what is the salary distribution based on job title. There is a great knowledge in the responses that may help inexperienced developers to get better, business owners and managers to choose what technologies to use (what is popular) or show HR specialists and job seekers about the market compensations. Shown above is a brief analysis and visualisations of what is most interesting for me. There are many questions and relations that I have not analysed, although it may be interesting for others.
